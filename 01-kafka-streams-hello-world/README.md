# Kafka Streams Hello World

In this workshop we will learn how to process messages using the [KafkaStreams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) library.

We will create a basic processor which consumes messages from a topic, processes them and produces the result into a new topic. We will be using once using the High-Level DSL and once the more low-level Processor API.
